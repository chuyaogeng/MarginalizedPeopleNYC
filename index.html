        <h2>Where do you live in NYC?</h2>

<p>As you can see from the map, the color shows the amount of people who are either disabled or have limited english proficiency. From all the five dataset I got from U.S. Census, I think these two are the factors that define people in difficulties. And these groups are usually marginalized in the society. Check your neighborhood, see if there are a lot of marginalized people live close to you.</p>

<p>You can also check the other livelihood data if you click the neighborhood. These datasets use the number of people in the described situation in each neighborhood to show the point. <p>
          

<h2>What are the blue dots?</h2>

<p> <!--<img src="/image/canner.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:500px;"> -->
    The blue dots are the location of redemption center. Redemption Centers are often small businesses that accept empty containers for 5Â¢ from the public.
They are crucial for more than 7000 Canners in NYC, who redeem the bottles and cans they found on the street for living.  </p>

<p>Without Redemption Centers, people have to go to retailer store that are required to accept containers by law. However, it's not preferable because those shops make things hard for canners as they want customers not people with big pile of bottles. For example, some of them only take 120 bottles per time which worth $6, some would say they only accept bottles during 2am-4am. </p>

<h2>What is the relationship between livelihood data and redemption center?</h2>
<p>Most canners have no other career option because of health issue, aging, or language barrier. Canning is a low barrier job. Though it is also a very laborious job. It helps people to be able to pay for rent and feed their kids. </p>
  
<p>According to Sure We Can, the only non-profit redemption center in NYC, the ethnicity of canners is:
          <ul>
          <li>40% Hispanic (Spanish speaking) </li>
              <li>35% Asian (Chinese speaking) </li>
            <li>25% African American (English speaking) </li>
              <li>5% Caucasian (mostly Polish speaking) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are interested in canners, please check the video.</p></p>
