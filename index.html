        <h2>Where do you live in NYC?</h2>

<p>As you can see from the map, the color shows the amount of people who are either disabled or have limited english proficiency. From all the five dataset I got, I define these two as a facture of people with difficulty. And usually, they are marginalized in the society. Check your neighborhood, see if there are a lot of marginalized people live close to you.</p>

<p>You can also check the other livelihood data in the right side widgets. The daker the neighborhood is, the more people in the selected situation. <p>
          

<h2>What are the blue dots?</h2>

<p> <!--<img src="/image/canner.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:500px;"> -->
    The blue dots are the location of redemption center. Redemption Centers are often small businesses that accept empty containers for 5Â¢ from the public.
They are crucial for more than 7000 Canners, who redeem the bottles and cans they found on the street for living.  </p>

<p>Without Redemption Centers, people have to go to retailer store that are required to accept containers to redeem. It's not preferable because those shops make hard rules for canners as they want customers not people with big pile of bottles. </p>

<h2>What is the relationship between livelihood data and redemption center?</h2>
<p>Most of people who are canning have no other career option because of health issue or language barrier. Canning is a low barrier job. Though it is also a very laborious job. It helps people to be able to pay for rent and feed their kids. </p>
  
<p>According to Sure We Can, the only non-profit redemption center in NYC, the ethnicity of canners is:
          <ul>
          <li>40% Hispanic (Spanish speaking) </li>
              <li>35% Asian (Chinese speaking) </li>
            <li>25% African American (English speaking) </li>
              <li>5% Caucasian (mostly Polish speaking) </li>
          </ul>
